# wwhf_2024_badge_notes
As a virtual atendee of WWHF 2024, I was grateful to recieve a blank PCB. For the onsite atendees, this was fully built out and used in the fun onsite badge games. Hopefully I can turn this into something usefull and learn some new skills along the way!

* this looks useful after I get something soldered together: ladderlogix/2024-WWHF-Badge-Writeup
* shout out to shilo from the discord server for providing pictures of the built board!

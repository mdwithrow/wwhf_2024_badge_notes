# wwhf_2024_badge_notes
As a virtual atendee of WWHF 2024, I was grateful to recieve a blank PCB. For the onsite atendees, this was fully built out and used in the fun onsite badge games. Hopefully I can turn this into something usefull and learn some new skills along the way!

⚠️ I don't know what I'm doing with most of this... if someone more knowledgable wants to collaborate, please jump in!⚠️

## Notes and questions
* this looks useful after I get something soldered together: [ladderlogix/2024-WWHF-Badge-Writeup](https://github.com/ladderlogix/2024-WWHF-Badge-Writeup)
* more reference for learning: [eurofurence/ef28-badge]()https://github.com/eurofurence/ef28-badge
* shout out to shilo from the discord server for providing pictures of the built board!
* everything seems to be surface mount solder
* for display module, i'm assuming the just bent the pins down and soldered to the pads? There seemed to be issues with them falling off from the announcements made.
